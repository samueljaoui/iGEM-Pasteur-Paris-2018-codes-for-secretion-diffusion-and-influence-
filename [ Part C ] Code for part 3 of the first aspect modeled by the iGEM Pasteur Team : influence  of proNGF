##This code provides the evolution of the growth of the neurons over time.
It creates two matrices : g and gcontrol whichold the value of the lengths of the axones at different times
when their is a gradient of NGF in the media ( for the matrix g ) and when their isn't ( for the matrix gcontrol). 
For each value of g at a given time, the [Part B] provides the value of the NGF gradient concentration at this position and at this time,
the code then calculates the new length of the neuron at the next time.##


g=zeros(length(t),1); % matrix holding the values of g for each different t when there is a gradient of NGF in the media 
gcontrole=zeros(length(t),1); % matrix holding the values of g for each different t when there is a gradient of NGF in the media
G0=10^-7; % cm.s-1 , baseline growth rate 
k=10^-9;  %  cm2.ml.s-1.ng-1 , gradient factor 
g(1)=0.01; % cm, intial length of the neuron 
gcontrole(1)=0.01; % cm, initial length of the neuron 

for i = 2:9999
    
    gcontrole(i)=gcontrole(i-1)+dt*(G0);
    g(i)=gcontrole(i); 
    if g(i)>L
        break 
    end 

end  

for i = 10000 :length(t)
      
     g(i)=g(i-1)+dt*(G0+k*codegithubinfluence2(L-g(i-1),i));
    gcontrole(i)=gcontrole(i-1)+dt*(G0);

     if g(i)>L
